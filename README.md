# Ailing Planet

![](https://github.com/codingedward/ailing-planet/blob/master/screenshot.png)

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive timelapse of the COVID-19
pandemic as it has occurred. 

At every point in the time of the visualisation, the red bars represent the impact
of the virus on countries relative to the most impacted country.

You can view it [here](http://covid-live.com).
